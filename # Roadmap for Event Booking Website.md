# Roadmap for Event Booking Website with Floor Planning Features

## Phase 1: Planning and Requirement Analysis
- Define core features:
  - User authentication (signup, login, roles like organizer, exhibitor, and attendee).
  - Event browsing and booking.
  - Interactive floor planning (drag-and-drop, area selection).
  - Payment integration.
  - Dashboard for organizers to manage bookings and floor plans.
  - Notifications (email/SMS).
  - Review and feedback system.
- Create wireframes and prototypes.
- Finalize tech stack with the MERN stack:
  - **Frontend:** React.js.
  - **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js.
  - **Database:** MongoDB.
  - **State Management:** Context API or Redux.

## Phase 2: Design
- Design the user interface (UI) using tools like Figma or Adobe XD.
- Ensure responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile views.
- Create design systems with reusable components.

## Phase 3: Development

### Backend Development
#### Setting up the Server:
1. Initialize the project:
   ```bash
   mkdir event-booking
   cd event-booking
   npm init -y
   npm install express mongoose dotenv cors bcryptjs jsonwebtoken stripe
   npm install --save-dev nodemon
   ```
2. Create the folder structure:
   ```
   backend/
     |-- controllers/
     |-- models/
     |-- routes/
     |-- middleware/
     |-- config/
     |-- server.js
   ```
3. Set up `server.js` with Express.js and connect to MongoDB:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const mongoose = require('mongoose');
   const cors = require('cors');
   require('dotenv').config();

   const app = express();
   app.use(cors());
   app.use(express.json());

   mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI, {
       useNewUrlParser: true,
       useUnifiedTopology: true,
   }).then(() => console.log('MongoDB Connected'))
     .catch(err => console.log(err));

   app.listen(process.env.PORT || 5000, () => console.log('Server running...'));
   ```

#### Implementing Features:
1. **Authentication and Authorization:**
   - Use JWT for token-based authentication.
   - Hash passwords with `bcryptjs`.
   - Create middleware for protecting routes.

2. **Event and Booking Management:**
   - Define Mongoose schemas for users, events, and bookings.
     ```javascript
     const mongoose = require('mongoose');

     const EventSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
       title: String,
       description: String,
       date: Date,
       location: String,
       price: Number,
       seatsAvailable: Number,
     });

     module.exports = mongoose.model('Event', EventSchema);
     ```
   - Create CRUD routes and controllers for event and booking management.

3. **Payment Integration:**
   - Use the Stripe API for handling payments.
   - Create a route to generate payment intents.

4. **Real-time Features:**
   - Use Socket.IO to enable real-time updates for the floor plan and notifications.

### Frontend Development
#### Setting up the Frontend:
1. Initialize the React app:
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app frontend
   cd frontend
   npm install axios react-router-dom redux react-redux @mui/material
   ```
2. Create the folder structure:
   ```
   src/
     |-- components/
     |-- pages/
     |-- redux/
     |-- services/
     |-- App.js
   ```

#### Implementing Features:
1. **Authentication:**
   - Create login and signup forms.
   - Use `axios` to connect with backend authentication endpoints.
   - Store JWT in localStorage and manage user state with Redux or Context API.

2. **Event Browsing and Booking:**
   - Fetch event data using `axios` and display it with Material-UI components.
   - Create a booking form and integrate payment functionality.

3. **Interactive Floor Planning:**
   - Use `react-konva` for drag-and-drop functionality.
   - Allow organizers to create and save floor plans.
   - Enable attendees to view and select booths dynamically.

4. **Dashboard:**
   - Create separate dashboards for organizers and attendees.
   - Include features for managing bookings, viewing statistics, and editing floor plans.

### Deployment
- **Backend:** Deploy on platforms like Render or AWS.
- **Frontend:** Deploy using Netlify or Vercel.
- **Database:** Use MongoDB Atlas.

## Phase 4: Testing
- Perform unit testing with Jest and integration testing with Cypress.
- Test APIs with Postman.
- Conduct end-to-end testing to ensure smooth user workflows.

## Phase 5: Launch and Post-launch
- Launch the website and monitor using analytics tools like Google Analytics.
- Gather user feedback and iterate for improvements.
- Plan for additional features, such as 3D floor planning and advanced search filters.
